README for the VLC media player
===============================

VLC is a popular libre and open source media player and multimedia engine,
used by a large number of individuals, professionals, companies and
institutions. Using open source technologies and libraries, VLC has been
ported to most computing platforms, including GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X,
BSD, iOS and Android.
VLC can play most multimedia files, discs, streams, allows playback from
devices, and is able to convert to or stream in various formats.
The VideoLAN project was started at the university Ã‰cole Centrale Paris who
relicensed VLC under the GPLv2 license in February 2001. Since then, VLC has
been downloaded close to one billion times.

Build instructions (macOS):

Please install th266dec in '/usr/local' directory. This is the default if it is build from source (on macOS).

Build commands for macOS:
mkdir build
cd build
JDK_HOME="" ../extras/package/macosx/build.sh -c -j 4

This build commands have been tested on macOS 10.15.6, Xcode version 11.6 (11E708).
More information can be found at https://wiki.videolan.org/MacOSCompile.
Build on other platforms may be possible but has not been tested.

Note:
The build process will download and build the dependencies from source, which takes a long time.

For example, the input is input.bin at 50fps.
./build/bin/vlc-osx-static input.bin --no-drop-late-frames --avformat-fps=50
